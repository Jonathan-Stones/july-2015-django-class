Class 1 Topics
==============

The topics we'll be covering for the first class revolve around setting up custom environments for your Django project.

Motivation
----------

When working in a team of people it is very important that everyone is contributing on congruent environments.  Imagine the confusion if developers have different database definitions, template directories or tests!

Goals
-----

 - Django project creation
 - Define a modular, scalable and intuitive project structure
 - Setup place-holders for custom environment settings

Tasks
-----

 - Create a settings module with a base, dev, production, test and local settings.
 - Define an ADMINS setting.  Where should this be defined?
 - Properly define DEBUG
 - Setup template and static structures
 - Define the database for each environment
 - Define common and accounts apps for the project
 - Define a base model to provide timestamp functionality
 - Create a custom authentication user with a rewards level (bronze, silver and gold)
 - Create place-holder 404.html and 500.html files.
 - Create a place-holder CSS file static/css/website.css.
 - Initialize migrations and make sure they run properly
